ruby-grep
=========

ruby-grep is an enhancement over the standard unix grep utility.

  - Highlights found patterns in lines 
  - Outputs line numbers and filenames
  - Carefully indents the output

Usage
-----
ruby-grep dir_name (string | regexp)

TODO
----
1. This program is too slow cause written in ruby, rewrite back-end so that it uses original grep
